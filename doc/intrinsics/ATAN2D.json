This function can be used to transform from Cartesian into polar coordinates and allows to determine the angle in the correct quadrant.\nThis function is for compatibility only and should be avoided in favor of standard constructs wherever possible.\n### Standard\nGNU Extension, enabled with -fdec-math\n### Class\nElemental function\n### Syntax\nRESULT = ATAN2D(Y, X)\n### Arguments\n- Y: The type shall be REAL.\n- X: The type and kind type parameter shall be the same as Y. If Y is zero, then X must be nonzero.\n### Return value\nThe return value has the same type and kind type parameter as Y. It is the principal value of the complex number X + i Y. If X is nonzero, then it lies in the range -180 \\le \\atan (x) \\leq 180. The sign is positive if Y is positive. If Y is zero, then the return value is zero if X is strictly positive, 180 if X is negative and Y is positive zero (or the processor does not handle signed zeros), and -180 if X is negative and Y is negative zero. Finally, if X is zero, then the magnitude of the result is 90.\n"
