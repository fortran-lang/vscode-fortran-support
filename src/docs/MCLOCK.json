{"keyword":"MCLOCK","docstr":"`MCLOCK` â€” Time function\n\n### Description\nReturns the number of clock ticks since the start of the process, based\non the function `clock(3)` in the C standard library.\n\n     \nThis intrinsic is not fully portable, such as to systems with 32-bit\n`INTEGER` types but supporting times wider than 32 bits. Therefore,\nthe values returned by this intrinsic might be, or become, negative, or\nnumerically less than previous values, during a single run of the\ncompiled program.\n\n\n\n\n### Syntax\n`RESULT = MCLOCK()`\n\n\n### Return value\nThe return value is a scalar of type `INTEGER(4)`, equal to the\nnumber of clock ticks since the start of the process, or `-1` if\nthe system does not support `clock(3)`.\n\n\n\n### Standard\nGNU extension\n\n\n\n### Class\nFunction\n\n\n\n### See also\n<a href=\"CTIME.html#CTIME\">CTIME</a>, <a href=\"GMTIME.html#GMTIME\">GMTIME</a>, <a href=\"LTIME.html#LTIME\">LTIME</a>, <a href=\"MCLOCK.html#MCLOCK\">MCLOCK</a>, <a href=\"TIME.html#TIME\">TIME</a>\n\n   "}
