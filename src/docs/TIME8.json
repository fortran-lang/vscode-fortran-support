{"keyword":"TIME8","docstr":"`TIME8` â€” Time function (64-bit)\n\n### Description\nReturns the current time encoded as an integer (in the manner of the\nfunction `time(3)` in the C standard library). This value is\nsuitable for passing to `CTIME`, `GMTIME`, and `LTIME`.\n\n     \n<em>Warning:</em> this intrinsic does not increase the range of the timing\nvalues over that returned by `time(3)`. On a system with a 32-bit\n`time(3)`, `TIME8` will return a 32-bit value, even though\nit is converted to a 64-bit `INTEGER(8)` value. That means\noverflows of the 32-bit value can still occur. Therefore, the values\nreturned by this intrinsic might be or become negative or numerically\nless than previous values during a single run of the compiled program.\n\n\n\n\n### Syntax\n`RESULT = TIME8()`\n\n\n### Return value\nThe return value is a scalar of type `INTEGER(8)`.\n\n\n\n### Standard\nGNU extension\n\n\n\n### Class\nFunction\n\n\n\n### See also\n<a href=\"CTIME.html#CTIME\">CTIME</a>, <a href=\"GMTIME.html#GMTIME\">GMTIME</a>, <a href=\"LTIME.html#LTIME\">LTIME</a>, <a href=\"MCLOCK8.html#MCLOCK8\">MCLOCK8</a>, <a href=\"TIME.html#TIME\">TIME</a>\n\n   "}
