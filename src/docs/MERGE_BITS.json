{"keyword":"MERGE_BITS","docstr":"`MERGE_BITS` â€” Merge of bits under mask\n\n### Description\n`MERGE_BITS(I, J, MASK)` merges the bits of `I` and `J`\nas determined by the mask.  The i-th bit of the result is equal to the\ni-th bit of `I` if the i-th bit of `MASK` is 1; it is equal to\nthe i-th bit of `J` otherwise.\n\n\n\n### Syntax\n`RESULT = MERGE_BITS(I, J, MASK)`\n\n\n### Arguments\n\n     \n. \n\n | `J`     | Shall be of type `INTEGER` and of the same\nkind as `I`. \n\n | `MASK`  | Shall be of type `INTEGER` and of the same\nkind as `I`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Return value\nThe result is of the same type and kind as `I`.\n\n   \n\n### Standard\nFortran 2008 and later\n\n\n\n### Class\nElemental function\n\n\n"}
