    "docstr":"`TIME` — Time function\n\n### Description\nReturns the current time encoded as an integer (in the manner of the\nfunction `time(3)` in the C standard library). This value is\nsuitable for passing to `CTIME`, `GMTIME`, and `LTIME`.\n\n     \nThis intrinsic is not fully portable, such as to systems with 32-bit\n`INTEGER` types but supporting times wider than 32 bits. Therefore,\nthe values returned by this intrinsic might be, or become, negative, or\nnumerically less than previous values, during a single run of the\ncompiled program.\n\n     \n\nSee <a href=\"TIME8.html#TIME8\">TIME8</a>, for information on a similar intrinsic that might be\nportable to more GNU Fortran implementations, though to fewer Fortran\ncompilers.\n\n\n\n\n### Syntax\n`RESULT = TIME()`\n\n\n### Return value\nThe return value is a scalar of type `INTEGER(4)`.\n\n\n\n### Standard\nGNU extension\n\n\n\n### Class\nFunction\n\n\n\n### See also\n<a href=\"CTIME.html#CTIME\">CTIME</a>, <a href=\"GMTIME.html#GMTIME\">GMTIME</a>, <a href=\"LTIME.html#LTIME\">LTIME</a>, <a href=\"MCLOCK.html#MCLOCK\">MCLOCK</a>, <a href=\"TIME8.html#TIME8\">TIME8</a>\n\n   "
