    "docstr":"`RANDOM_INIT` — Initialize a pseudo-random number generator\n\n### Description\nInitializes the state of the pseudorandom number generator used by RANDOM_NUMBER.\n### Standard\nFortran 2018\n### Class\nSubroutine\n### Syntax\nCALL RANDOM_INIT(REPEATABLE, IMAGE_DISTINCT)\n### Arguments\n- REPEATABLE: Shall be a scalar with a LOGICAL type, and it is INTENT(IN). If it is .true., the seed is set to a processor-dependent value that is the same each time RANDOM_INIT is called from the same image. The term “same image” means a single instance of program execution. The sequence of random numbers is different for repeated execution of the program. If it is .false., the seed is set to a processor-dependent value.\n- IMAGE_DISTINCT: Shall be a scalar with a LOGICAL type, and it is INTENT(IN). If it is .true., the seed is set to a processor-dependent value that is distinct from th seed set by a call to RANDOM_INIT in another image. If it is .false., the seed is set value that does depend which image called RANDOM_INIT.\n"
