{"keyword":"MINLOC","docstr":"`MINLOC` â€” Location of the minimum value within an array\n\n### Description\nDetermines the location of the element in the array with the minimum\nvalue, or, if the `DIM` argument is supplied, determines the\nlocations of the minimum element along each row of the array in the\n`DIM` direction.  If `MASK` is present, only the elements for\nwhich `MASK` is `.TRUE.` are considered.  If more than one\nelement in the array has the minimum value, the location returned is\nthat of the first such element in array element order.  If the array has\nzero size, or all of the elements of `MASK` are `.FALSE.`, then\nthe result is an array of zeroes.  Similarly, if `DIM` is supplied\nand all of the elements of `MASK` along a given row are zero, the\nresult value for that row is zero.\n\n\n\n### Syntax\n\n     \n\n\n | `RESULT = MINLOC(ARRAY [, MASK])`     <br>\n\n\n\n\n\n### Arguments\n\n     \n or\n`REAL`. \n\n | `DIM`    | (Optional) Shall be a scalar of type\n`INTEGER`, with a value between one and the rank of `ARRAY`,\ninclusive.  It may not be an optional dummy argument. \n\n | `MASK`   | Shall be an array of type `LOGICAL`,\nand conformable with `ARRAY`.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### Return value\nIf `DIM` is absent, the result is a rank-one array with a length\nequal to the rank of `ARRAY`.  If `DIM` is present, the result\nis an array with a rank one less than the rank of `ARRAY`, and a\nsize corresponding to the size of `ARRAY` with the `DIM`\ndimension removed.  If `DIM` is present and `ARRAY` has a rank\nof one, the result is a scalar.  In all cases, the result is of default\n`INTEGER` type.\n\n\n\n### Standard\nFortran 95 and later\n\n\n\n### Class\nTransformational function\n\n\n\n### See also\n<a href=\"MIN.html#MIN\">MIN</a>, <a href=\"MINVAL.html#MINVAL\">MINVAL</a>\n\n   "}
