{"keyword":"MCLOCK8","docstr":"`MCLOCK8` â€” Time function (64-bit)\n\n### Description\nReturns the number of clock ticks since the start of the process, based\non the function `clock(3)` in the C standard library.\n\n     \n<em>Warning:</em> this intrinsic does not increase the range of the timing\nvalues over that returned by `clock(3)`. On a system with a 32-bit\n`clock(3)`, `MCLOCK8` will return a 32-bit value, even though\nit is converted to a 64-bit `INTEGER(8)` value. That means\noverflows of the 32-bit value can still occur. Therefore, the values\nreturned by this intrinsic might be or become negative or numerically\nless than previous values during a single run of the compiled program.\n\n\n\n\n### Syntax\n`RESULT = MCLOCK8()`\n\n\n### Return value\nThe return value is a scalar of type `INTEGER(8)`, equal to the\nnumber of clock ticks since the start of the process, or `-1` if\nthe system does not support `clock(3)`.\n\n\n\n### Standard\nGNU extension\n\n\n\n### Class\nFunction\n\n\n\n### See also\n<a href=\"CTIME.html#CTIME\">CTIME</a>, <a href=\"GMTIME.html#GMTIME\">GMTIME</a>, <a href=\"LTIME.html#LTIME\">LTIME</a>, <a href=\"MCLOCK.html#MCLOCK\">MCLOCK</a>, <a href=\"TIME8.html#TIME8\">TIME8</a>\n\n   "}
